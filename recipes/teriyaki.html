        <h3 class="tertiary">Description</h3>
        <p>Salmon is a favorite of my husband. This recipe never fails to be a hit, whether we broil the salmon in the oven or grill it outdoors. Pair it with some homemade teriyaki fried rice to complete your meal.</p>

        <h3 class="tertiary">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li class="li">¼ cup sesame oil</li>
            <li class="li">¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li class="li">¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li class="li">2 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li class="li">1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
            <li class="li">1 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
            <li class="li">1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li class="li">¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li class="li">4 (6 ounce) salmon steaks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="tertiary">Steps</h3>
        <ol class="step-list">
            <li class="li">Mix sesame oil, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, sesame seeds, ground mustard, ginger, and garlic powder in a small saucepan over low heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring until sugar has dissolved. Set aside 1/2 cup of marinade for basting.</li>
            <li class="li">Pour remaining marinade into a resealable plastic bag and place salmon into the marinade. Squeeze air out of the bag, seal, and marinate the salmon steaks for at least 1 hour (2 hours for better flavor). Drain and discard used marinade.</li>
            <li class="li">Set oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place salmon steaks into a broiler pan and broil for 5 minutes. Brush steaks with reserved marinade, turn, and broil until fish is opaque and flakes easily, about 5 more minutes. Brush again with marinade.</li>
